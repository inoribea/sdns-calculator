# sdns-calculator

DNS Stamp calculator component for Python

- Thanks for jedisct1 and qwq-plus  
- Code implementations sourced from [stamps-specifications](https://dnscrypt.info/stamps-specifications/)  
## Why
I cannot properly obtain the certificate and compute the hash for the compute server through dnscrypt-proxy. When I have this trouble, I have not found a suitable local solution, which prompted me to use AI to generate this code.
## 使用
1.Install Python  
2.Importing cryptography Python modules  
3.Download scripts for your language  
4.Run it!
